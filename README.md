# Multilingual Vec2Text 

Multilingual Vec2Text supports research in Text Embedding Inversion Security in Language Models, extending Jack Morris' [Vec2Text](https://github.com/jxmorris12/vec2text) with Ad-hoc Translation and Masking Defense Mechanism. We investigate throughly multilingual and crosslingual text reconstructions, and potential defense mechanisms.

It is not easy to set up experimental environment for such large-scale experiment. The tutorials for setting up experiments in supercomputer LUMI is in Wiki pages. All the scripts for running experiments are provided in the GitHub repository.
